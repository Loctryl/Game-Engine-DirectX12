# gtech3-proj3-directX12_engine

Student project with a team of 4, during 3 weeks.
The goal was to start a game engine from scratch, only with the DirectX12 API, and to make a game with this engine.

The game had to be a first person space shooter.

Theorically, you can just pull the repo and it compiles.
